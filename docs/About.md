# How Bitcadia Works

# Basics

We created a system of publication that ensures the most accurate and
interesting information published on the internet bubbles to the top. Here's how
Bitcadia works step by step.

1. A **Publisher** puts a **Claim**
   - The Publisher researches and writes an claim they think is worth publishing
     and is interesting enough to publish on Bitcadia.
2. The Publisher backs their claim with collateral and selects a judge
   - By backing their claim with a bounty for proving them wrong, the Publisher
     signals they believe their story to be true and incentivizes others to fact
     check their information.
3. Bitcadia matches readers with **Judges**
   - Using filters selected by users and signals about the trustworthiness of
     judges, Bitcadia recommends judges to you based on topics you're interested
     in.
4. **Readers** see the most interesting and accurate stories backed by collateral to
   trusted judges
   - Readers of Bitcadia select judges who they trust to adjudicate claims who's
     subjects the judges have become experts at adjudicating. Readers can even
     add to the collateral if they wish to incentivize others to fact check an
     claim.
   - Readers can subscribe to curators for interest specific feeds of stories
     from publishers governed by their trusted judges.
5. **Moderators** challenge stories.
   - Moderators look for stories with large bounties and bring evidence
     attempting to disprove them.They too select a judge to adjudicate the claim
     they are challenging.
6. The **Judges** write their opinions.
   - Judges weigh the evidence presented to them about the veracity of the
     claim. If the judges agree, their decisions are final. If they disagree,
     then an appeal judge(selected beforehand by the judges) will adjudicate the
     judges' disagreements.
7. **Readers** are updated about the veracity of any stories they've seen.
   - By tracking claims you've read, Bitcadia displays updates to you about any
     decisions made on claims you've read.

It used to be said that a lie can travel half way around the world before the
truth even ties its shoes. Well, no more.

Moderators are here to ensure lies, untruths, and misinformation are quickly and
profitably rebutted. They are the work horses of Bitcadia, the detectives, the
internet sleuths, the people who take the publishers to task. The look at all of
